The purpose of the project was to create a Web 
application that intermediates book exchages between 
bibliophiles. A user of this application that can 
connect through the HTTPS protocol to the server of 
the application and consents to location sharing when 
prompted by his browser(that has to support HTML5
geolocation API) will receive a notification through 
email each time another BooX user is close to him and
has a book of which he is interested in. The application
displays book descriptions using a Google API.
